#====================  PATTERN  ========================
Need to set up a sting to print out the *

Then set up a for loop to get 9 rows make an if statement
in the loop that checks if the iteration is <=5 if it is then
prints out the * string timed by the i (current iteration to
get an increase of * per iteration up to row 5)

with this method for the * to decrees it needs to deduct 1
initial from the set variable n and continue to deduct 1 with each
iteration and then it prints the string timed by the n variable

this gives out the pattern

#============== WHILE ================

creates an empty global list that can be edited in
the while loop and append every user input

Asks the use input for a number and gives what
condition needs to be met to stop the loop

Creates a while loop with a condition if user enters -1
the loop exits

If the user input is no -1 it adds that current input
to the inputs list keeps asking for the input again

if the user input is -1 it it stops the loop and calculates
the sum of all the inputs so far excluding the -1

then calculates the average by calculating the sum divided
by the length of the list finally prints out the sum
